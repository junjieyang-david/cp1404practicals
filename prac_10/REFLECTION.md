Estimations for Practical Tasks

Throughout the course, I think each week's practical tasks took about three or four days to complete, and the whole subject added up to about a month. At first, I struggled to accurately identify and understand the logic in the code, which affected my overall efficiency. As the course progressed, I found it easier and easier to dissect and understand the logic behind the programs. This significant improvement allowed me to solve tasks more efficiently and showed a steady improvement in my accuracy throughout the subject.

Code Reviews

Reviewing code and being reviewed by others has been an enlightening experience. It has added a deeper understanding of computing code and code accuracy for me. This feedback mechanism has helped me to continually improve the readability of my code. Conversely, when I review other people's code, it provides an opportunity for a different approach to problem-solving. I am able to learn from these unique perspectives and incorporate some of their approaches into my own work.

Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of this subject, I would make some changes to the practical tasks. Specifically, I would add the number of combinatorial procedures, as well as introduce more engaging and enjoyable projects, which could increase student engagement and comprehension.
